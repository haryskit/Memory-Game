# SEO Improvements Walkthrough

I have enhanced the SEO and social media presence of your Memory Game website. Here is a summary of the changes:

## 1. Logo and Favicon
- **Generated Logo**: Created a modern, minimalist logo featuring a stylized brain/card design.
- **Favicon**: Added the logo as the website favicon so it appears in browser tabs.
- **Apple Touch Icon**: Added support for iOS home screen icons.

## 2. Meta Tags (`index.html`)
- **Title**: Updated to "Memory Master - Brain Training & Cognitive Assessment" to be more descriptive.
- **Description**: Added a compelling description for search engine results.
- **Keywords**: Added relevant keywords (memory game, brain training, etc.).
- **Author**: Set to "Harshit Singh Chouhan".
- **Theme Color**: Set to `#4a00e0` to match the game's theme in mobile browsers.

## 3. Social Media Optimization (Open Graph & Twitter Cards)
- **Open Graph**: Added tags so that when the link is shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc., it shows a rich preview with the title, description, and the new logo.
- **Twitter Cards**: Added tags for a large image summary card on Twitter.
- **URL**: Configured to point to `https://haryskit.github.io/Memory-Game/`.

## 4. Search Engine Indexing
- **robots.txt**: Created a file to tell search engines they are allowed to crawl the site.
- **sitemap.xml**: Created a sitemap to help search engines find your page.

## Verification
You can verify these changes by:
1.  Pushing the changes to GitHub.
2.  Visiting your live site.
3.  Checking the browser tab for the new icon.
4.  Sharing the link on a platform like Twitter or LinkedIn (or using a debugger tool like [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)) to see the rich preview.
